            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            Coding has come a long way since the first programming language, that was written in the early 1950’s. It has developed from a hobby to a critical career skill.
            <p>It has changed everything, and it is only going to continue to grow</p>
            </article>
                <p>Learning this skill will helps your think outside the box. With all the critical thinking and problem solving you become more detail oriented. Which will make you a better designer.
                </p>
                <p>Even if you are not completely confident and know it fully, there is great value in knowing the basics for future employers. Now a days, there are more hybrid positions opening in the work force rather than “Computer programmer” job openings.</p>

                <p>Overall, there are a lot of perks to learning and practicing code. Before we start coding there are a couple things you need to understand first.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Client Server Model</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>The web is sometimes referred to as a client-server model of communications. </li>
                <li>There are two types of actors: clients and servers.</li>
                <li>The server is a computer agent that is normally active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, listening for queries from any client who make a request.
                <li>A client is a computer agent that makes requests and receives responses from the server, in the form of response codes, images, text files, and other data.</li>
                <li>The request-response loop is the most basic mechanism on the server for receiving requests and transmitting data in response.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The 3 Layers of a web page</h2>
                <strong>Structure</strong>
                <p> The structure or theme of a web-page is the bare bones of the web design. It is reffered to as a content layer. It is the foundation of a web-page. There are different parts - the text, hyperlinks to navigate, and the images.</p>
                    <strong>Style</strong>
                    <p>This will define how the content will appear to site visitors. This is composed of the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</p>
